Hi guys I would like to set up a prototype of an AI model, integrating the past traffic record & pattern, and make a traffic forecast based on that for the restaurants

I have a Chinese article here saying a Japanese company doing the same thing, please have a look ï¼ˆplease use Google Translate if you do not understand Chinese cause I just have this unfortunately).

The only thing different is they have their own POSs and capture the data based on that, I need to take them from different major POS vendors here (formats are surely different).

I have one example from one of the major POS players here with some dummy figures for your easy understanding.

By using this AI model, the merchants should have a much better idea to know the restaurant occupancy(in %) in different periods (down to 30 mins slot).

Some factors to capture:

Arrival Time
Billing (end) time
Average $ of original bill
Occupancy (merchant provides the full capacity), so to know the peak time
Fringe time(heimdall style)
Weather(temperature, humidity, sunny/cloudy/rainy,etc)
Event
public holiday
